# statistics_tools_for_ALevel_students
some self-made tools to calculate statistical values

these were made when I was studying S1 and S2

"gouped_main_menu" is the file that calls "group_mean" which calls "mean_calculate" and "midpoint", which can calculate the mean of grouped values and the midpoint of one group

e.g.

 1 ≤ x < 2  | 2 ≤ x < 3
 :----: | :-----:
 2  | 4


"binomial", "percentile", and "passion" are independent. their function is the same as their name.
